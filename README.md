# An-effective-decision-support-system-for-detecting-mental-state
This an decision support system for detecting mental state where mental state can be predicted using ML algorithm. four mental state can be predicted. Positive, Neutral,Depressed and Anxiety. The states are predicted using numerical EEG frequencies from brain wave. 
Install Necessary libraries in your virtual environment before using the system. MYSQL Database script also given here.
